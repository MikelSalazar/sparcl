# Setting up a new experiment

The main aim of sparcl is to consume content from the AR Cloud. To make this for the end user as easy and enjoyable as possible for the user is clrearly the highest priority for the development process. 

One important requirement for this is, to make sure the content received from an AR Cloud provider is displayed correctly, and it can be used as intendet. For this, sparcl offers separate modes to help with content creation and development. While we think that these modes are quite useful as they are, because they take away any dependency on a correctly set up server configuration, they might be too inflexible for some requirements.

This is why sparcl also offers the possibility to write experiments, which removes any restrictions. The developer can use the functionality sparcl offers or create something completely new, like replacing the XR or 3D engine.

This guide wants to get you started quickly with a new experiment. Feel free to have a look at the [description of the architecture](https://openarcloud.github.io/sparcl/architecture/experiments.html) behind this functionality.
