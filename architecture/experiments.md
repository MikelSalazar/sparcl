# Integrating Experiments

The main goal of sparcl is, to serve as a proof of concept and as an experimentation platform around the AR Cloud. This document outlines how experiments can be integrated. An important pre-requisite is, that the experiments source needs to be integrated into the sparcl project from a separate repository. There are several ways to do so. The example uses Git submodules.
